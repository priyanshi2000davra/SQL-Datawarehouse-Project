A comprehensive guide to building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.

SQL-Datawarehouse-Project
Building a datawarehouse

🌐 Overview

This project represents a Data Warehouse architecture built using SQL Server, designed to collect, clean, and transform data from different sources like CRM and ERP systems into business-ready insights for reporting and analytics.

🧱 Architecture Layers

1: Sources
-Data comes from CRM and ERP systems.

-These are CSV files stored in folders like customer details, product info, and sales records.

2: Bronze Layer – Raw Data
-This layer stores the raw data exactly as it is from the source.

-Load Type: Batch or Full(Bulk load) load using stored procedures.

-No transformations are done here.

-Purpose: to preserve original data for auditing or reprocessing.

3: Silver Layer – Cleaned & Standardized Data
-Here, data is cleaned and standardized.

Transformations include:

-Data cleansing (remove nulls, fix errors)

-Data standardization (consistent formats)

-Data normalization

-Derived columns (like profit = revenue - cost)

-Data enrichment (adding extra useful info)

-This layer prepares data for business use.

4: Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data
-Data here is transformed into business models for analytics.

Transformations:

-Data integration (joining CRM & ERP data)

-Aggregations (like total sales per month)

-Applying business logic.

Data Models: Star schema, flat tables, or aggregated tables.

📈 Consume Layer (Outputs)

-The cleaned and modeled data is consumed by:

-BI & Reporting tools – dashboards and reports.

-Ad-hoc SQL Queries – for analysis by data analysts.

-Machine Learning – predictive models using structured data.

🔁 Data Flow

-Data flows from CRM and ERP → Bronze Layer (raw tables) → Silver Layer (cleaned tables) → Gold Layer (fact and dimension tables). -CRM and ERP data → cleaned customer and product info → combined into dim_customers, dim_products, and fact_sales tables.
